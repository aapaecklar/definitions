**Status**:

  application definition, extends :ref:`NXobject`

**Description**:

  Application definition for stress and strain analysis of crystalline material defined by the `EASI-STRESS consortium <https://easi-stress.eu>`_.

  When a crystal is loaded (applied or residual stress) its crystallographic parameters change.

  Stress and strain analysis calculates deformation (strain) and the associated force (stress)
  from diffraction data.

  This application definition essentially standardizes the result of diffraction pattern analysis
  from different types of diffraction experiments for the purpose of stress and strain analysis.
  The analysis is typically some form of diffraction peak indexing and fitting.
  The experiments are for example

  - energy-dispersive X-ray powder diffraction
  - angular-dispersive X-ray powder diffraction
  - angular-dispersive neutron powder diffraction
  - time-of-flight (TOF) neutron powder diffraction.

  Sample and detector positions can be defined with :ref:`NXtransformations`. If you don't specify the direction of gravity
  and the direction of the beam then the standard NeXus Coordinate System is used.

**Symbols**:


  **nX**: Number of diffractogram channels.

  **nD**: Number of diffractograms. For example the number of energy-dispersive detectors or the number of azimuthal sections in an area detector.

  **nPeaks**: Number of reflections.

  **xUnit**: Diffractogram X units.

  **yUnit**: Diffractogram Y units.

  **cUnit**: Converted diffractogram X units (could be the same as *xUnit*).

**Structure**:

  .. _/NXstress/Shared_Information-group:

  **Shared_Information**: (required) :ref:`NXcollection`

    In this group parameters should be listed that are the same for all measurements (acquistions) 
    included in the same file. This information is then displayed through a link in all the individual 
    acquistions within the same measurement file.

    For example, if during an acquisition all instrumental parameters but one stay the same and only the sample table moves in one direction (e.g. Xtranslation), then all the static instrumental parameters
    will be saved just once in the *Shared_Information* group and their vales linked to every *instrument group* under each acquistion. The value for the variable that changes, Xtranslation in this example,
    will only be saved at every *instrument group* under each acquistion but not in the *Shared_Information* group. It is not always necessary to link each field. In case all the fields with an entire group
    are the same, the entire group can be linked.

          This field can be two things:

          #. For a pixel detector it provides the nominal wavelength
             for which the detector has been calibrated.

          #. For other detectors this field has to be seen together with
             the efficiency field above.
             For some detectors, the efficiency is wavelength dependent.
             Thus this field provides the wavelength axis for the efficiency field.
             In this use case, the efficiency and wavelength arrays must
             have the same dimensionality.

            multipliers are assumed to be printed as subscripted numbers.
        * Unless the elements are ordered in a manner that corresponds to their chemical 
            structure, the order of the elements within any group or moiety depends on 
            whether or not carbon is present.
